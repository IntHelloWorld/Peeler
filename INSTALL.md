# Installation
This is the instruction on package and dataset installation.
## Environment
We implement *Peeler* with Python 3.6.13, which can be installed on [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
### CUDA
We use CUDA 11.1 for training *Peeler* with GPU, CUDA 11.1 can be download on [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.1.0-download-archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.1.0-download-archive).
### PyTorch
We use PyTorch to build the neaural network, it can be installed on [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Remember to select the correct OS (Linux) and CUDA version.
### Packages
In order to use *Peeler*, the following Python packages are required, the users are able to install them by pip through these commands:
```shell
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install prettytable
pip install sklearn
pip install argparse
pip install tqdm
pip install logging
```

## Dataset
For user convenience, we preprocess the corpus and make the dataset that can be directly fed to *Peeler*.
The processed corpus and dataset can be downloaded at [https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WuxhiwHwOy0l0LhwxXZcqw?pwd=7mf3](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WuxhiwHwOy0l0LhwxXZcqw?pwd=7mf3).
